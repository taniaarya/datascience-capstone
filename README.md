## Citi Bike Ridership & Public Safety During COVID-19

In the face of our nation's ongoing battle with the public health crisis, COVID-19, the Citi Bike electric rental bike stations in New York City, NY are still in business. These bikes are points of human contact and unfortunately can serve as vectors for the spread of germs and viruses such as COVID-19. Citi Bike is privately owned by Lyft, but is a public bike sharing system that leverages mobile technology to serve regions in the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Jersey City, NJ. Their organization and technical capabilities extend beyond their app and into the realm of data collection as the company stores detailed information on all bike rides since 2013. Their faithful data collection offers an interesting dataset to conduct further analysis to gain insights on anything from coordinate data, station locations, gender analysis of riders, and even the durations of trips.

However, for the purposes of our analysis, we would like to answer the question: How has Citi Bike ridership behavior changed after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic? More generally, we would like to use insights gained from our data to see if we can increase the safety of Citi Bike locations in terms of minimizing the spread of the virus.
